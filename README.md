## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

* Freshen up on how to style a page with basic css.
* How to change values with the @media css property


```css
@media screen and (max-width: 500px){
  body {
    margin-top: 30%;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

Would like to refine how I impliment margins and padding. Feel like I can do the same thing but with less code in my css for centering the container.

Also would like to learn how to center a component vertically without doing weird margin properties.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media) - This helped me remember how to implement the @media property.
